# UMich Biostat 699

[Biostatistics 699](https://sph.umich.edu/admissions/courses/course.php?courseID=BIOSTAT699) is a semester-long course in the Department of Biostatistics at University of Michigan. The course is about consultation, analysis, and presentation skills for biostatisticians in the context of biomedical or public health research.

I completed the course in 2021 while enrolled in Biostatistics PhD program, and here I've uploaded my code from three of the projects as examples of how I organize my analysis. However, these are probably not the *best* examples of my code because the projects needed to be completed on a short timeline (a few weeks per project), and I didn't always take time to refactor/optimize the code.

I wrote reports based on these analyses using R Markdown, but I haven't uploaded those documents because they describe data that were confidential and provided for instructional purpose only.

### Project 1

Data from the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) registry were used to investigate the associations of patient characteristics (e.g. age, body weight, blood gas measurements) with mechanical complications (e.g. component failures or clotting) during ECMO life support.

### Project 2

Data from a cluster-randomized trial of motivational interviewing for the treatment of pediatric obesity were analyzed to assess the intervention's effect on secondary outcomes.

### Project 3

Data from the NEPTUNE cohort of nephrotic syndrome patients were analyzed to investigate the associations of socioeconomic factors with remission and progression of kidney disease.
